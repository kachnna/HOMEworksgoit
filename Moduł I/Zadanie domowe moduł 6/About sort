<!-- Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the sort.py does:

It imports the required libraries, including os, shutil, re, sys, and pathlib.

It defines a function replace_polish_char(text) to replace Polish characters with their corresponding English characters.

It defines another function normalize_file_name(filename) to normalize file names by replacing non-alphanumeric characters with underscores.

It checks if the script is provided with the correct number of command-line arguments (i.e., the folder path). If not, it displays a usage message and exits.

It reads the folder path from the command-line argument.

It defines a dictionary type_directories that maps file categories (e.g., 'Audio', 'Images') to lists of file extensions associated with those categories.

The script walks through the folder structure using os.walk, iterating over files in the specified directory.

For each file, it normalizes the filename and determines the file extension.

If the file is an archive (e.g., .zip, .rar), it extracts the contents to a temporary directory (unpacked_files) and sorts them.

It then moves the extracted files to appropriate subdirectories based on their file extensions.

If the file is not an archive, it determines the appropriate subdirectory based on its file extension and moves it to that directory.

Finally, it cleans up the temporary directory used for extracting archive files and removes any empty directories.

The script concludes by printing a message indicating that the files have been sorted and the file names have been normalized.

This script can be useful for organizing and cleaning up a directory containing various files by categorizing them into specific subdirectories and standardizing the file names. However, please note that it should be used with caution, as it performs file operations and directory modifications. Always make sure to have backups of your data before running such scripts. -->
